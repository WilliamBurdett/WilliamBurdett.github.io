    In Grimtools you can search using regular expressions (often shortened as "regex") if you put your search query in slashes ( / )<p/>

    A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern<p/>

    Example: /[%] aether damage/<p/>

    In the above exaple we use "/" at the start and the end of the search query to let grimtools know that we will be using regular expressions.<p/>

    The regular experssion we use here is "[^ ]", which excludes the characters contained within the brackets from the search. In this case we don't want to look "%". This leaves only flat damage bonuses and procs that deal Aether damage.<p/>

    There are many regular expressions and their syntax can become very complicated when many criteria are included.<p/>

    This tools is designed to automatically generate the desired regular expressions, based on the user's criteria.<p/>
